# SFC Deployment Environment with Security Constraints

## Overview

This project implements a reinforcement learning environment using OpenAI's Gym framework for the deployment of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) in a physical network. The environment simulates the deployment of service function chains (SFCs) with considerations for security levels, processing demands, and network capacity.

## Features

- **Dynamic Physical Network Generation**: Generate a physical network with configurable initial capacities, security levels, and costs for each node.
- **SFC Chain Management**: Support for multiple SFC chains with varying VNF requirements.
- **Reinforcement Learning Integration**: Utilizes a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent for training and optimizing VNF deployments based on observed states and rewards.
- **Security Constraints**: Incorporates security levels into the deployment decision process to ensure that VNFs are placed in nodes that meet their security requirements.
- **Visualization**: Provides visual representation of the network deployment using NetworkX and Matplotlib.
